## [Talking ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzdJslToeOU&t=14s)

An App for having convenient conversations with ChatGPT.

## Show some :heart: and star the repo to support the project.

## Reasons of Development
I found ChatGPT conversations inconenient for the following reasons:
 * If we have a long query, we need to write it
 * If response from ChatGPT is very long, we need to read it
 * We can not ask ChatGPT to generate an image

To solve all the problems mentioned above, I decided to develop the app "Talking ChatGPT".
   
## Features

 * Users can first register on the application
 * After registration, users can login with the registered id
 * Password recovery system is also embedded
 * Profile Screen
   * All your conversations will be displayed
   * If you don't have any conversation, it will display the text "You don't have any conversation"
   * Any conversation can be either resumed or deleted any time
   * You can start a New Conversation
 * Chat Screen
    * Send the query either by writing or by just speaking it
      * So, we no longer are required to write the complete query ðŸ¤©
    * ChatGPT will also speak its response
      * So, we no longer are required to read the complete response ðŸ¤©
    * You now can also ask it to generate an Image ðŸ¤©
